                <p>My name is Voravich Silapachairueng. I was born in Thailand, but lived
                    in the United States for most of my life. I had studied Cognitive Science
                    at Brown University in hopes to pursue research, but decided to change
                    my course and pursue software development and computer science instead.
                    Thus, I am currently enrolled at the University of Pennsylvania for an
                    MCIT to become a proficient programmer! I love tabletop role-playing games,
                    as I joined with the recent rise of Dungeons and Dragons. This hobby, I believe,
                    encompassing my love for telling and creating stories. Programming, in a sense,
                    is very similar to telling a story, as I can set the scene with objects to
                    interact with and set the results of users' actions. I hope this mission statement
                    will evolve into a career working in fresh, new interactive media, such as VR, AR,
                    and associated technologies.
